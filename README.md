# Jake-s-Snake-Game

# Don't worry. You're figuring it out one step at a time. This is the start of the journey - get good at this and you'll be able to knock out anything

# This repository is Jake's first official project. I've got a pretty bullet proof process and this is the first attempt at refining that process.

# The snake game is not a new idea but an enjoyable one nonetheless. I'm hoping to add a modern spin on a timeless classic.

# It was this or sudoku so just be thankful.
